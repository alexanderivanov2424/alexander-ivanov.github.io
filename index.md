I am a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> PhD student at Brown University working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>. I am a part of the <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/"> Intelligent Robot Lab (IRL) </a> and the Brown <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI</a> initiative.

I study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning (RL)</a> with the goal of creating general purpose robots that can learn from raw sensorimotor data. I believe that the ability to discover representations that permit decision making over various timescales is a hallmark of intelligence and will allow AI agents to solve hard problems in harsh environments. As a result, I am currently working on solving the skill discovery problem - how can agents automatically break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems by simply interacting with their environment?

I graduated from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2016, where I was part of the <a href="https://www.lair.hmc.edu">Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)</a> and was advised by Professor Chris Clark. I then worked at Apple in Cupertino, CA for 2 years as part of the Multitouch Algorithms team under the leadership of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FingerWorks">Wayne Westerman</a>.

### __Work Experience__
* **Jul 2020**: Our paper *Skill Discovery for Exploration and Planning using Deep Skill Graphs* was accepted at the <a href="https://lifelongml.github.io" target="_blank">4th Lifelong Learning Workshop</a> at ICML 2020. It was great fun to present this paper virtually at the workshop!
* **Apr 2020**: I virtually presented my poster for Deep Skill Chaining at ICLR 2020. Here is the link to my recorded video <a href="https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_B1gqipNYwH.html" target="_blank"> presentation</a>.
* **Dec 2019**: Our paper *Option Discovery using Deep Skill Chaining* has been accepted for ICLR 2020! Can't wait to go to Ethiopia!
* **Dec 2019**: I presented a poster on skill discovery at the Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop at NeurIPS in Vancover, Canada
* **Oct 2019**: I proposed my research comps on *Skill Discovery for Long Horizon Problems*. Thanks to my committee members <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/" target="_blank">Michael Littman</a> and <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu" target="_blank">Stefanie Tellex</a> for their valuable feedback. Looking forward to making some progress on this problem and defending next semester!
